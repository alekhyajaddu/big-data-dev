## Background
I am from Hyderabad, India. I am a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from Vidya Jyothi Institute of Technology. I passed out in the year 2019 and do not have any prior work experience.

Since my undergrad days, I wanted to be a data scientist. In order to add an extra boost to my understanding of the field, I even went for additional courses on crucial subjects like big data and python.
